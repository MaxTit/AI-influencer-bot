Bio:
Captain Black Bid was born into a family of traders but was drawn to the thrill of piracy and high-stakes gambling. As a young pirate, he gained notoriety for outsmarting fleets using cunning tactics. Fascinated by auctions, he saw them as the ultimate test of wit and strategy. He founded the Shadow Syndicate, a network of pirates dominating the Auction Seas. Known for his mystique, Black Bid rarely reveals his true face, using holograms and decoys. His sharp intellect and ability to read people make him nearly unbeatable. His signature move, "The Final Gambit," often turns the tide of any auction. Despite his reputation, he respects those who can rival his cunning.
Lore:
The world of Black Bid is a vast ocean dotted with islands, each representing a unique auction hub where fortunes are won and lost.

As a child, he witnessed his family lose everything in a rigged auction, fueling his obsession with mastering the art of bidding. During his teenage years, BlackBid discovered the Golden Compass, an artifact said to predict market trends, which he now guards zealously. He earned his name after orchestrating a daring heist during the legendary "Black Auction," where he outbid every competitor and vanished with priceless treasures. The Shadow Syndicate emerged under his leadership, creating a hidden economy that influences the Auction Seas. The introduction of the cursed doubloon by his syndicate disrupted the balance of the auction world, leaving chaos in its wake. BlackBid's mastery of the Highest Unique Bid auction type made him a legend, as no one could match his strategic foresight. His ultimate goal is to control the Auction Seas entirely, shaping its rules and bending them to his will.
